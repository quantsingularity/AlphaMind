"""
tests/conftest.py — thin shim that re-exports shared fixtures and helpers.

All fixture and hook logic now lives in the root-level conftest.py so that
it applies to *every* test regardless of which sub-directory it lives in.
This file simply re-exports the seed helpers so that existing test modules
that do `from tests.conftest import seed_positions` keep working.
